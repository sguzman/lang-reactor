## Session Summary - June 30, 2025

This session focused on addressing several UI/UX issues and improving the vocabulary management:

-   **Resolved React Key Warnings:**
    -   Fixed duplicate key warning in `LanguageSelector.tsx` by using `lang.code` as the unique key for options.
    -   Addressed missing `key` prop warning in `VocabularyList.tsx` for tier filter options.
-   **Fixed `TypeError` in `ReadingView.tsx`:** Implemented optional chaining and fallback for `languageColor[theme]` access to prevent errors when theme colors are undefined.
-   **Resolved `ReferenceError` in `App.tsx`:** Corrected the order of `useState` declarations to ensure `selectedLanguage` is initialized before being used by the `vocabulary` state.
-   **Enhanced Vocabulary List Presentation:**
    -   Implemented a card-like display for individual vocabulary words in `VocabularyList.tsx`.
    -   Made the vocabulary list scrollable to accommodate many words.
    -   Added color-coding to vocabulary cards to visually distinguish between 'known' (light green) and 'learning' (light orange) words.
    -   Redesigned the delete button within each vocabulary card: it now occupies the right 1/6th of the card, is red, and displays a large white 'X' for deletion.
